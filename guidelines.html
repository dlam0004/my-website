                <p>Managing Your LIFEHUB Account: Important Guidelines</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use of Real Names:</strong>
                        <p>Using your real name helps build trust and fosters meaningful relationships. Whether youâ€™re making friends, networking, or collaborating, others want to know who they are interacting with, and real names play a vital role in creating authentic connections.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Public and Private Information:</strong>
                        <p>Your city location will be visible to everyone, but your exact street address and apartment details will remain private. Birthday information is required for your profile, but you can choose whether to make it public or private.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Profile Information Settings:</strong>
                        <p>Certain details, such as occupation and interests, are required for your profile, but you have full control to make this information private or public, depending on your comfort level.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Control Over Posts:</strong>
                        <p>When sharing, reposting, or making a post, you can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disable joining of your event or post.</li>
                            <li>Hide your post from specific people by customizing your audience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Post Author Rights:</strong>
                        <p>As the author of a post or event, you have the power to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Approve or decline who can join the interaction.</li>
                            <li>Control who will be part of the group or event, giving you full discretion over the attendees.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Direct Messaging Restrictions:</strong>
                        <p>Only people you have added as friends or those within your HUB can message you directly. This ensures that your inbox stays private and relevant to your connections.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Group Chats:</strong>
                        <p>Group chats for events or posts are optional. You can choose to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mute or exit any group chat at any time.</li>
                            <li>You will never be added to group chats automatically; you must opt in to join.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Temporary Event Chats:</strong>
                        <p>For one-time events, group chats will automatically be dissolved 24 hours after the event ends, preventing excess chats and keeping your experience organized and distraction-free.</p>
                    </li>

            <h3>Community Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                At LIFEHUB, we strive to foster a respectful and safe environment for all users. Our guidelines are designed to ensure positive interactions that mirror how we treat each other in real life. Key points to keep in mind include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encouraging Group Interactions</strong>: To ensure everyone feels safe and comfortable, 
                    avoid one-on-one meetings with strangers unless they are part of your close circle. 
                    We recommend participating in group events or activities with at least three people.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect and Integrity</strong>: Treat others with kindness and respect. 
                    Topics such as harassment, hate speech, violence, and inappropriate content are strictly prohibited. 
                    </li>
                <li><strong>Control Over Your Posts</strong>: You have the right to control who can view and engage with your posts. 
                    This includes the ability to allow or block users from interacting with your content.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy and Information Sharing</strong>: While providing accurate information enhances your experience on LIFEHUB, 
                    you can decide which details to keep private and which to share publicly.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting Concerns</strong>: If you encounter inappropriate content or behavior, 
                    you can report it directly through the app. 
                    </li>
