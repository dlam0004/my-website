            <h2>Who We Are?</h2>
            <p>
                LIFEHUB is more than a social platform—it's a community-driven space where people from all walks of life can connect, 
                interact, and grow. We believe in the power of real human connections and aim to foster relationships that empower individuals 
                to thrive. Unlike traditional social media, LIFEHUB encourages users to engage actively with their surroundings, 
                building meaningful, real-world communities.
            </p>


            <p>
                At LIFEHUB, well-being is a journey, not a destination. 
                By promoting genuine interactions and the use of real identities, we foster trust and safety. 
                We go beyond virtual experiences, creating a space where digital friendships can blossom into real-life connections. 
                With LIFEHUB, you'll move from observing life on a screen to living it in your community.

        <!-- Section 2: Why LIFEHUB -->
        <div class="about-container">
            <h2>Why LIFEHUB?</h2>
            <p>
                LIFEHUB offers a unique space where people can meet, network, and grow—both personally and within their community. 
                We provide opportunities for meaningful relationships and mentorships, all while prioritizing the well-being of our users. 
                Social media should be a tool for empowerment, not just passive consumption. 
                Instead of scrolling through others' lives, LIFEHUB encourages you to engage with the world around you.

                their support for one another, and their shared desire to make a positive impact. 
                Together, we create a vibrant network of like-minded individuals who strive to build stronger, 
                more connected communities. As part of our growth strategy, we encourage users to invite friends to join,
